    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/afternoonrobot/photographer-io/releases/tag/v1.1.0">v1.1.0 has been released on our GitHub repo</a>. This is the first release since open sourcing <a href="https://www.photographer.io">Photographer.io</a> last week, and includes a large amount of bugfixes, a reasonable amount of internationalisation, and a small number of new features.</p>

<p>I have decided to aim for a tagged release around every 2 weeks, to give me a target to hit for adding new features and to provide stable points in the application&rsquo;s history for others to use. There is still a lot to do in relation to documentation, testing, and workflow improvements (such as actually tagging patch releases), but there has been a <em>lot</em> of improvements since the open source announcement.</p>

<p>If you want to get involved then all <a href="https://github.com/afternoonrobot/photographer-io">the code is available on GitHub under an MIT license</a>, or if you fancy translating the app to another language then <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/photographerio">come join us on Transifex</a>.</p>
